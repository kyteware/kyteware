## Hi 👋

- 🧠 I mostly work on operating systems, hardware and graphics/raytracing, but sometimes I mix in some games, apps and math.
- 📖 I've written tons of Rust and Python, but I also use Julia, Shell, Java and C.
- ✏️ I tend to switch between projects a lot, you can see what I'm working on in [my repos](https://github.com/Dworv?tab=repositories).
- 💬 You can reach me at `kyteware` on Discord.

## Big Goals
I have a few far-reaching goals that I'd like to achieve some day, namely:
- [ ] A GPU-accelerated video editor capable of running natively or on the web with WGPU
- [ ] A VR desktop that fully takes advantage of Wayland's unique capabilities
- [ ] A programming language complete with a fully functional, from-scratch compiler
