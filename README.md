## Hi 👋

- 🧠 I love systems, hardware and graphics/raytracing, but I'm also not afraid of a little games, apps and math.
- 📖 I don't care much for arguing about programming languages, but I'm used to writing Rust and Python, and have also written a fair bit of Java, Julia, Bash, Lua, C, C++, WGSL and ARM Assembly.
- ✏️ You can see what I'm working on right now in [my repos](https://github.com/kyteware?tab=repositories), but bear in mind that I don't always publish what I'm working on. Also, for privacy reasons some of my repos might have parts omitted.

## Big Goals
I have a few far-reaching goals that I'd like to achieve some day, namely:
- [ ] A GPU-accelerated video editor capable of running natively or on the web
- [ ] A VR desktop that fully supports windows meant for desktop
- [ ] A programming language complete with a fully functional, from-scratch compiler
